        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My name is Jacqueline, I am English and grew up on the south coast of England, then moved to London and spent 30 years living and working in London. <br> 
          I trained as a Verbatim Reporter and worked for many years at the Old Bailey and the High Court, whilst also working in private business, such as the General Medical Council. <br>
          I also worked in London for an Insurance Company, Banking, and Accountants.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I believe the best way to learn English is by using it with confidence, not memorising endless rules. My lessons are practical, engaging, and student-focused, designed to get you speaking from day one.<br>
          Every class is built around your goals, whether that’s passing an exam, improving your career prospects, or feeling comfortable in real-life conversations. I combine structured learning with natural conversation, so you improve your fluency, accuracy, and confidence at the same time.<br>
          I create a relaxed and supportive learning environment where mistakes are part of the process. Lessons are clear, motivating, and results-driven, with continuous feedback and progress tracking.<br>
          With 10 years of experience I know how to adapt quickly to different learning styles and keep lessons focused, enjoyable, and effective.
