        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I am a lawyer from the United Kingdom with a long-standing passion for teaching and international education.<br>
          <br>
Since 2009, I have worked with a wide range of learners from around the world, both face to face and online. My teaching experience includes professionals learning Business English (3.5 years), teachers working in the social sciences and university students preparing for Cambridge University examinations.<br>
          <br>
My legal background strongly influences my teaching style, particularly in areas such as clear communication, precision and confidence. I focus on practical, real-world language skills and support students in communicating effectively in academic, professional and international settings.<br>
          <br>
One of my proudest moments as a teacher was supporting a student who delivered a speech at the United Nations in March 2025.  Experiences like this remind me of the impact thoughtful, focused teaching can have on a student’s confidence and opportunities.

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My teaching approach is centred on clarity, effectiveness and respect for each student’s individual learning pace.  I am a clear and structured communicator and place great importance on helping students fully understand concepts rather than rushing ahead. In my experience, real progress comes from steady, confident learning - not from speed.
<br>
          <br>
I am organised and methodical in my lessons, while remaining patient and flexible. I encourage students to  build strong foundations before moving forward. This creates lasting results and helps students develop genuine confidence in their abilities.<br>
          <br>
          I aim to create a friendly, relaxed learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. I am empathetic to individual needs and adapt my teaching to suit different learning styles, goals, and professional or academic contexts.<br>
          <br>
Above all, my goal is to support students in developing practical skills, confidence and independence, so they can communicate effectively and achieve their personal, academic, or professional objectives.
