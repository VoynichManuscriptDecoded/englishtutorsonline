        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Hello! I’m Clare and I’m from Cambridge, UK, but now I live and work in Seville in Spain.<br>
I have 24 years of teaching experience, and I have taught students of all ages, from children to adults. Over the last few years, I have focused mainly on Business English, teaching both one-to-one classes and group classes in multinational companies.<br>
I believe that every student is different, so I tailor my classes to each student’s needs, goals, and level. Whether you need English for work, exams, travel, or daily communication, I design lessons that are practical, clear, and motivating.<br>
I have taught students from many different countries and cultures, both in person and online, and I have experience working on several online teaching platforms.<br>
I also have strong experience in exam preparation, helping students successfully prepare for the Cambridge English exams and Trinity exams, from B1 to C2 level.<br>
My aim is to help you feel confident, comfortable, and successful when using English in real life.
