        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">So, you’ve decided to improve your English skills? Well, you’ve come to the right place! My name is Rachel. I’m an English teacher from Wales, living in Spain. I have been teaching English for over 16 years and have taught all ages, from 2-year-olds to students over 70. My experience spans preparing learners for Cambridge, IELTS, the Official School of Languages and Language Cert exams, as well as teaching Business English, Legal English and Medical English. Now that you know a little about me, don’t hesitate to get in touch so that we can start working toward achieving your goals.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Having taught such a wide variety of students, I’ve learned that there is no “one size fits all” approach to language learning. I like to use the approach that best suits each student. We will decide this together in our first session. The goal is to enjoy the whole experience of learning: covering listening, speaking, reading and writing. This “tailored to your needs” approach allows me to really understand your goals and, unlike a classroom environment, we can work at a pace that suits you. As soon as you decide to begin your learning journey, we will create a plan together which can be accessed and updated whenever necessary. I aim to offer a relaxed environment where you can feel comfortable and at home during your sessions.</div>
