        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I have been teaching English online for about seven years. 
          My students range from School students to Scientists. I studied History in college and for many years I worked repairing and maintaining aircraft. So my interests are varied!<br>
I have trained extensively in public speaking and have many years experience. I help those whose English is their second language to feel comfortable and confident speaking in front of an audience, however large!<br>
I’ve also had training from the British Council to help students with their IELTS exam, mainly the speaking section but also with the written part of the exam.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I am flexible when it comes to teaching. Some students want a rigid, structured approach, while others want to have an open conversation and learn in a natural, organic way.<br>
          I do my best to suit the students' style and teach in a way that is most effective and comfortable for them. </div>
