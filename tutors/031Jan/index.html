        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I am a family man and I like to spend time with family members and friends. In my free time I enjoy gardening, especially cultivating vegetables. 
I also like watching different types of sports, such as cricket, tennis, rugby, etc.
Travelling around my country is something that I try to do as often as possible. I prefer going to places renowned for natural beauty rather than visiting cities.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My aim in teaching is to assist students to achieve their goals and improve their skill levels. At the same time I would also want to build a relationship of trust with students so that they feel free to interact and communicate in an open way. 
I also know that one method of teaching does not have the same effect on all the students and therefore I make use of different methods. I want students to regard the learning process as a journey of discovery. Sometimes the road is easy and familiar and sometimes it is more complicated. My function is to guide students along this road. It is my responsibility to determine what their goals are and to plan and design my sessions in such a way that they will achieve these goals.</div>
