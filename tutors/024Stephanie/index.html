        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Hello! I’m a Bostonian living in Seville, Spain. I have over 18 years of experience as an English language teacher and would love to help you on your language journey!<br>
I am a certified primary school teacher in Spain and currently completing a Master’s degree in Bilingual Education. I have years of experience preparing students for official exams and helping professionals succeed in Business English.<br>
I'm also a mom of 3 small children. I love reading, cooking, travel, watching tv shows, running, hanging out and eating around beautiful Seville, and going to the beach.

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I’m easy to talk to, a great listener and I truly enjoy teaching learners of all ages, from children and teenagers to adults of all levels.<br>
          I’ve worked with students from around the world, both individually and in company group courses in Spain, Italy, and China, so I’m very comfortable adapting lessons to different cultures, goals, and learning styles.<br>
Every lesson is 100% personalised to your needs and objectives. We’ll focus especially on speaking, grammar, listening, and expanding your vocabulary, while also improving key skills like pronunciation, reading, and writing.<br>
          You’ll receive clear error correction and constructive feedback during every session so you can see real progress. My classes are dynamic, supportive, and conversation-driven, designed to help you gain confidence, speak more fluently, and use English naturally in real-life situations.
