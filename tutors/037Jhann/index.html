        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My name is Jhann and I'm from San Diego, California, one of the most beautiful places in the world. Okay, I might be biased but it does have some of the best beaches with tons of wildlife and reefs, and our mountains are gorgeous in the winter.<br>
          My main profession is teaching, but I have dipped into other fields like hospitality, tourism, sales, and law enforcement throughout my working career, so teaching English has not been my only job.<br>
          I like to play rugby but relish watching all sports, just not golf. In my downtime, I like going on drives and hikes with friends, going to amusement parks, reading or staying home, and binge-watching shows; my taste is eccentric and depends on my moods.<br>
          I'm curious and love to learn, so I like to do or learn anything, even if it is just for a moment. I am a bit of a foodie so I like most cuisines. I really enjoy traveling to experience new cultures and explore other's history.<br>
I have personal experience working in other fields, like but not limited to, Hospitality, Law Enforcement, and Sales. Also, I have been learning three languages, as well.<br>
          All these tributes, I have realized, help me better relate to my students and their struggles, as well as, pull knowledge from all my experiences to help guide my students in practical situations.

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I have been teaching virtually and in classrooms since 2010 and tutoring since 2008. I have been certified since 2014 and my teaching methodology is a mixture of direct with a natural and communicative approach.<br>
          I rely on techniques teachers of 1st languages use while only allowing my students to speak in English. I create specialized lessons and programs for my students that adapt to their needs/goals.</div>
