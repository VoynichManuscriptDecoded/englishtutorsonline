        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I enjoy sports, music, reading,  creative writing and the countryside. I live in Cornwall, a beautiful part of the UK. I am married and have three children and right now, I have two foster children. We also have a cockapoo who I walk most days.<br>
I have lived in many places in the UK and Africa and have family connections around the Mediterranean and all over the world. I have worked in four different universities and a number of schools and colleges before beginning online teaching in 2016.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I have a friendly communicative approach to teaching. My aim is to make the student feel comfortable and confident to use the language that they already have (or have just learnt) and to build up vocabulary and grammar gradually in small natural steps. I encourage students to read engaging content or listen to podcasts or watch videos which leads to fun, interesting discussion, fluency and better language production in real life situations. My students are consistently happy with my teaching.</div>
