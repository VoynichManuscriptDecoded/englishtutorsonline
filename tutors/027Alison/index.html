        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Hi, I'm Alison and I'm a native English speaker from the UK. I am a fully qualified and experienced language teacher with over 20 years of experience teaching English at all levels.<br>
          Lessons are all completely tailored to individual requirements and with the aim of encouraging you to feel much more confident from the very first lesson.<br>
I have a BA degree in Politics from the University of Sussex and a Post Graduate Certificate of Education in Languages from the University of Sheffield. <br>
          I have taught English to all ages, groups and individuals, and I have been teaching languages online for about ten years now. <br>
          I have experience in General English (from complete Beginners to Advanced level), IELTS, Cambridge exam preparation, Business English and English for Academic Purposes.<br>
A qualified teacher, I have also worked in various creative industries, including Film, Television and Public Relations. I understand the needs of a fast-based corporate sector and have trained business executives from all over the world to help them improve their communication and presentation skills and succeed in the workplace.   
I love learning languages myself and speak French, German and Spanish, and am currently learning Italian. I am passionate about languages and like to think that I pass that enthusiasm on to my students.
