        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I have always loved teaching and learning and for many years my focus has been on teaching English.<br>
          I have taught in traditional schools/classrooms and for several years now my focus is online teaching. In fact my Master’s degree is in Teaching and Learning with Technology. I am also a Certified Professional Personal Coach. <br>
          Individual learning styles and motivation to reach goals are part of what drives me to teach English. I enjoy getting to know students and customizing sessions to be enjoyable and focused on achieving goals.  <br>
          I am from San Diego, California but I have been living in different parts of Mexico for the last six years. Currently I live in La Paz Baja California Sur Mexico. I enjoy visiting all the different towns and gorgeous beaches all over Baja. <br> 
          The motto here is “No Bad Days” and I appreciate the tranquil vibe and peaceful beauty here. <br>
          I also enjoy talking to my students from all over the world and learning about so many different places. I feel extremely blessed to have the opportunity to help each of you speak English.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">In every session we are focused on your goals. 
      I adapt each lesson to your level, learning style, and needs, whether you’re preparing for IELTS or another English exam, improving your everyday English, or building confidence for work.<br>
          We practice all skills—speaking, listening, reading, and writing—with a strong focus on building confidence through fluency, clear pronunciation, correct grammar, and natural communication. 
          Lessons combine real-life topics, practical activities, interactive activities and clear feedback so you always know how to improve. <br>
          I also specialize in business English, medical and legal English, resumes and CVs, interview practice, presentations, and public speaking. 
          My goal is to create a supportive, relaxed online space where you feel comfortable, make real progress, and can use English with confidence in real situations.</div>
