        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My name is Joanne and I am from England, although I have lived in Spain since 2009.<br>
I've been teaching English for over 16 years. I started out teaching children and adults  in English academies and began teaching online 4 years ago. <br>
          I have taught large groups of students as well as one on ones. I like to get to know my students and focus classes based on their interests.<br> 
          I especially enjoy playing games based on conversation and teaching interesting vocabulary such as idioms and phrasal verbs. English can be fun! <br>
          My classes tend to be relaxed and informal, although I am completely adaptable to your needs. All classes will be personalised.</div>
