    <!-- INTRO -->
    <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>

    <p>
      If you’ve found your way here, you’ve probably got some specific English language needs.
      If you think I can help (and I probably can), feel free to get in touch.
      I offer a free, no-obligation session where I can evaluate your English level and discuss how I can help you.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I love most about being an English teacher is helping people achieve their dreams — whether that's gaining
      a place at university, securing an international job, or simply enjoying the pleasure of engaging with English:
      one of the most wonderful and challenging languages in the world.
    </p>

    <!-- TEACHING EXPERIENCE (FULL BIO) -->
    <details>
      <summary>Teaching Experience & Background</summary>
      <p>
        I have been teaching English for over 20 years, following earlier careers in publishing,
        politics and international finance. These roles exposed me to many people and subjects,
        giving me a broad base of knowledge across multiple fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        After qualifying as an English teacher at IH London, I lived and worked in Russia, Malaysia, China,
        Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and Spain, where I now live. I hold the CELTA, DELTA and an MA (TESOL),
        was an IELTS examiner (IDP Certification), and have additional qualifications in Business English,
        online tutoring and translation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have written English language teaching materials for Cambridge University Press, Kaplan (IELTS preparation
        book), and various private language courses (mainly for the Middle East), as well as a series of Collins
        Checkpoint books used by English-medium schools outside the UK to prepare students for GCSE-level English.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the last five years I have been working exclusively online as both a teacher and a teacher trainer
        (International House).
      </p>

    <!-- DROPDOWN: EXPECTATIONS -->
    <details>
      <summary>What to Expect in Your Classes</summary>
      <p>
        Every student is different, and I can easily adapt my teaching to your learning style or meet a specific set
        of language needs. If you're preparing for an exam such as IELTS, we will work solidly on test practice so
        you feel confident and prepared. If your goal is to improve your conversation, we will focus on speaking,
        guided practice and relevant correction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our initial (free) meeting, we will discuss how you like to learn and I will offer suggestions on how to
        structure your lessons for the best results.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN: IELTS / CAE -->
    <details>
      <summary>IELTS 7 / CAE Expertise</summary>
      <p>
        As an examiner I have completed around 4,000 IELTS Speaking interviews and marked a similar number of Writing
        scripts. I specialise in helping students move from 6/6.5 to 7 or above. I have authored IELTS preparation
        materials for Kaplan and designed and facilitated IELTS prep courses for the British Council.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN: VOCABULARY -->
    <details>
      <summary>Vocabulary, Grammar & Expression</summary>
      <p>
        I am passionate about words — their meanings, subtleties and use. If you already know most of the grammar and
        want to refine your vocabulary, expression and precision, I can help you develop your English with clarity and
        confidence.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN: INTERVIEWS / PRESENTATIONS -->
    <details>
      <summary>Job Interviews & Presentations</summary>
      <p>
        I have helped many students prepare for job interviews with great success. I also enjoy working with students
        on presentations — both improving the text and coaching delivery and performance.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN: REFRESHING ENGLISH -->
    <details>
      <summary>Refreshing Rusty English</summary>
      <p>
        Many students come to me feeling that their English has become a little rusty after years without practice.
        Together we rebuild fluency and confidence so you can return to your previous level quickly.
