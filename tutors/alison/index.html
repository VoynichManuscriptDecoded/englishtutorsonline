    <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>

    <p>
      If you’ve found your way here, you’ve probably got some specific English language needs.
      If you can’t find what you're looking for below — but think I can help (and I probably can) —
      please get in touch. I offer a free, no-obligation session where I can evaluate your level
      and discuss how I can help.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I love most about being an English teacher is helping people achieve their dreams —
      whether that's gaining a place at university, securing an international job, or simply
      enjoying the pleasure of engaging with English: one of the most wonderful and challenging
      languages in the world.
    </p>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 1 — FULL BIOGRAPHY -->
    <details>
      <summary>Teaching Experience & Background</summary>

      <p>
        I have been teaching English for over 20 years, after careers in publishing, politics
        and international finance. The first two brought me into contact with many different
        people and subject areas, so I know a little about a lot of things.
      </p>

      <p>
        After qualifying as an English teacher at IH London I lived and worked in Russia, Malaysia,
        China, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and Spain, where I now live. I have a CELTA, DELTA and MA
        (TESOL), was an IELTS examiner (IDP Certification) and have qualifications in teaching
        Business English, online tutoring and translation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve written English language teaching materials for CUP, Kaplan (IELTS preparation book)
        and various private language courses (mostly for the Middle East) as well as a series of
        Checkpoint books for Collins which are used to prepare students for the English GSCE
        at English-medium schools outside the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the last five years I’ve been working exclusively online as both a teacher and a
        teacher trainer (International House).
      </p>

    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 2 -->
    <details>
      <summary>What to expect in your classes?</summary>
      <p>
        Every student is different, and I can easily adapt my teaching to your learning style or
        meet a specific set of language needs. So, for example, if you are doing the IELTS exam in
        a month or so, we will work solidly on test practice so you feel confident that you can
        perform at your very best in the exam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, if you wish to improve your English conversation, we will do a lot of talking (with
        appropriate corrections and input). During our initial, free, no-obligation meeting we can
        discuss how best you like to learn, and I will offer a variety of suggestions as to what
        we can do in class together.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 3 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Do you need an IELTS 7 or CAE?</summary>
      <p>
        As an examiner I’ve completed around 4,000 IELTS Speaking interviews and marked a similar
        number of Writing scripts. I specialise in helping people move from 6/6.5 to 7 or above.
        I’ve authored IELTS test prep materials for Kaplan and designed and facilitated IELTS test
        prep courses for the British Council.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 4 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Do you feel you know most of the grammar and want to improve and finesse your vocabulary?</summary>
      <p>
        I am totally passionate about words, their meanings and use. There’s nothing I enjoy more
        than discussing the subtleties of English and engaging with students who also love the
        language. Grammar can be fun, and I can always find the answers.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 5 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Do you need to give presentations or speeches in English or have a job interview?</summary>
      <p>
        I have helped many students prepare for job interviews, with a lot of success I am happy to
        say. I also really enjoy working with students on their presentations — helping with both
        the text and the delivery.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- DROPDOWN 6 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Do you worry that you are getting a bit rusty and want to brush up on your English?</summary>
      <p>
        I’ve worked with a lot of people who previously had a very good level of English, perhaps
        because they lived or worked in an English-speaking country, but feel they have lost some
        of it and want to get back to their previous level.
