        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Hi, I’m Christine, a CELTA-qualified tutor from England with over 15 years of experience.<br>
          I started teaching English in language schools 16 years ago while living in Bulgaria, before progressing to online teaching and I’ve never looked back.<br>
Now living back in the UK, I enjoy the flexibility of teaching online and the opportunity to meet students from all over the world. 
          I’ve truly met some fantastic people and love celebrating their successes with them.<br>
I also have a degree in Business, and a background in purchasing and facilities management, which helps me understand my students’ professional needs and challenges.</div>

      <details>
        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My teaching approach is student-centred, supportive, and practical.<br> 
          I believe every learner is different, so my lessons are carefully tailored to each student’s goals, level, and learning style.<br>
In my 1-to-1 online lessons, I focus on building confidence as well as accuracy, with plenty of speaking practice and clear, constructive feedback.<br> 
          I support students with general English, business communication, and exam preparation (including IELTS and Cambridge), always adapting lessons to suit their individual needs.<br>
I aim to create a relaxed and encouraging learning environment where students feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions, helping them make steady, real progress.</div>
