        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">My name is Sarah and I am from Yorkshire in The UK originally, but now live in Sevilla in the south of Spain. I’ve been working as a teacher and examiner for 20 years. I have many years of experience preparing students of all ages for Cambridge and IELTS exams. I also specialise in business English classes.<br>
          
I have a Psychology degree and am a UK qualified secondary school teacher with a PGCE in Social Sciences (post-graduate certificate in education). I am happy working with both teenagers and adults. I can of course provide criminal records checks to parents who book classes for their teenage children.<br>
          
Prior to becoming a teacher I worked as a flight attendant for five years, therefore I can also specialise in English related to aviation and the travel industries.<br>
 If you have any questions prior to booking, feel free to get in touch. Once your first class is booked, I will send you all the information you need to make the most of your classes.<br>
Whether you are aiming to take an exam, improve your English at work or become more confident with your spoken English for socialising and travel, I am here to help.

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">The approach will differ depending on the aims of each student. Overall I aim to follow a communicative approach where students can feel comfortable, enjoy their classes and make clear progress towards their goals.<br>
          For every student I will create a shared folder where I will record everything we cover in class, including homework tasks and feedback.
