        <summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">Do you want to speak your best, clearest and most confident English? If the answer is yes you've come to the right place!<br>
I’m Fran and I live in rural Portugal with my family, my kids are now teenagers, and furry friends. When I'm not teaching English online, I love to teach yoga in my home studio as well as taking long walks with the dogs.<br>
          My garden is my sanctuary. I have many fruit trees which I enjoy harvesting for eating or making preserves and I also grow my own vegetables. I'm an absolute nature lover and passionate about living a simple and sustainable life.<br>
          I also love to travel, not so long haul any more, and enjoy talking about different cultures, which I hope to do in our lessons!

I very much look forward to meeting you soon. All the best till then.</div>

        <summary>TEACHING APPROACH &amp; WHAT TO EXPECT</summary>
        <div class="drop-content">I specialise in accent reduction mostly for C1+ students who feel stuck at their current level and really want to make the leap to full proficiency/near native level.<br>
          I have proven methods,using specially designed material, involving drills, discussion and reading out loud, which I have used for several years with my students from all around the world to produce the desired result - to be able to speak the best and clearest English possible!<br>
During a class with me, as well as helping you with your accent, I will at all times carefully correct your grammar and vocabulary too, always suggesting more natural idioms, everything being carefully logged in a google doc, which you can also edit. eg add homework or make notes.<br>
If you decide to work with me, specifically on accent reduction, I supply you with clear to follow audios after each lesson.<br>
I believe all of the above give me the qualities needed to be a great teacher! A very clear to follow approach, a teacher with patience, kindness but a good dose of fun thrown in for good measure!</div>
